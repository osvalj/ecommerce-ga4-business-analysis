**Business-oriented analytics focused on growth and profitability**

## Executive Summary

This project presents a full performance analysis of an ecommerce business using Google Analytics 4 data, with a strong focus on business impact rather than descriptive reporting. The analysis investigates a relevant and common problem: significant traffic growth that does not translate into revenue growth.

The objective is to identify where misalignment occurs across acquisition, user behavior, product performance, and conversion, and to propose data-driven actions to improve commercial outcomes.

This is a real-world case based on actual ecommerce data. Due to confidentiality and access restrictions, the project is documented as an analytical case study rather than an interactive dashboard.

## Business Context

The analyzed company operates as an ecommerce with both online and physical stores, offering a wide catalog of musical instruments and related products. Over time, the business has expanded its value proposition to include services such as education, events, repairs, and rentals.

During the analyzed period (mainly 2024, compared against 2023), the business experienced strong growth in user traffic but a notable decline in revenue. Understanding this divergence is critical for strategic decision-making.

## Objectives and KPIs

The main objective of the analysis is to explain why increased traffic did not result in higher revenue and to identify opportunities for growth.

Key areas of focus include acquisition performance, user engagement, product and brand contribution, and conversion efficiency.

Core KPIs used throughout the analysis include sessions, users, conversion rate, total revenue, average order value, product and brand revenue contribution, and funnel drop-off rates.

## Data and Methodology

The analysis is based on Google Analytics 4 ecommerce data covering 2024, with year-over-year comparisons where relevant.

The workflow followed four main steps. First, traffic evolution and channel performance were analyzed to understand acquisition dynamics. Second, user behavior was reviewed through page views, engagement metrics, and content consumption. Third, product categories and brands were evaluated to identify revenue drivers and underperformers. Finally, the conversion funnel was analyzed to detect friction points and abandonment issues.

Visualizations used in this project correspond to the original analysis performed on real data. No live dashboard or data connection is included due to confidentiality constraints. The emphasis of the project is on analytical reasoning and decision-making.

## Key Insights

Traffic grew significantly year over year, yet total revenue declined sharply, indicating inefficiencies beyond acquisition. Cross-network channels generated the highest revenue volume, while Paid Social showed the highest average revenue per purchase, suggesting potential for optimization rather than scale alone.

User behavior analysis revealed strong interest in specific product categories, particularly guitars, and notable engagement with pages related to physical stores. However, these interactions did not consistently translate into conversions.

Product and brand analysis showed that top-viewed and top-selling items were not always aligned with revenue leaders. The company’s private label brand displayed relatively low revenue contribution despite showing higher-than-average conversion rates among users exposed to the brand.

The conversion funnel revealed very high abandonment rates, with only a small fraction of users completing a purchase, well below industry benchmarks.

---

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several opportunities emerge. Improving conversion efficiency should be prioritized before further traffic investment. Reducing friction in the checkout process and addressing funnel drop-off points would likely have immediate impact.

The private label brand represents a growth opportunity, as it shows strong conversion potential despite limited visibility. Increasing its prominence across educational content, navigation, and product discovery could improve its contribution to total revenue.

Additionally, aligning content, product recommendations, and merchandising strategies more closely with high-interest categories may help better monetize existing traffic.

## Limitations

This project does not include an interactive dashboard or direct access to the underlying data source. All findings are based on static visualizations and documented analysis performed during the original project. The conclusions and recommendations should therefore be interpreted within this context.
